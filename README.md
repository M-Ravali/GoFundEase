### Building and Running with Docker

# Prerequisites
â€¢	Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

# Step-by-Step Instructions
1.	Clone the Repository 
git clone https://github.com/M-Ravali/GoFundEase.git
cd GoFundEase
2.	Ensure Directory Structure Ensure your directory structure matches what is expected in your docker-compose.yml file: 

your-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/
â””â”€â”€ frontend/
    â””â”€â”€ public/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
        â””â”€â”€ index.
        
3.	Build and Run the Docker Containers 
docker-compose up --build

4.	Verify the Containers are Running After running the above command, Docker Compose will build the images and start the containers. You should see output logs indicating that both the backend and frontend services are up and running.

5.	Access the Application 
o	Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend of your application.
o	Backend: The backend service should be accessible at http://localhost:8080, though typically it will be called by the frontend service.
